    <div class="series-tag">Part 1 of 3: Empathy & Understanding Users</div>

    <div class="intro">
        <h2>What is Human Centered Design?</h2>
        <p>
            Human Centered Design (HCD) is an approach to problem-solving that puts people at the heart of the design process.
            Instead of designing products based on what we think users want, HCD requires us to deeply understand users' needs,
            behaviors, and pain points before creating solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think about the last time you used an app or website that was confusing or frustrating. That's often the result
            of design without empathy. HCD helps us create products that truly work for real people.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Why Empathy Matters in Design</h2>
        <p>
            Empathy is the foundation of Human Centered Design. It's the ability to understand and share the feelings
            of another person. In design, empathy means stepping into your users' shoes to see the world from their perspective.
        </p>

        <div class="concept-grid">
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>🎯 Better Solutions</h4>
                <p>
                    When you understand users deeply, you solve the right problems. Many products fail because they
                    solve problems users don't actually have.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>💡 Innovation</h4>
                <p>
                    Empathy reveals unmet needs and hidden opportunities. The best innovations come from observing
                    what users struggle with but can't articulate.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>✅ User Satisfaction</h4>
                <p>
                    Products designed with empathy are intuitive and delightful to use. Users feel understood
                    and valued, leading to higher satisfaction and loyalty.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>🚀 Reduced Waste</h4>
                <p>
                    Understanding users early prevents costly mistakes. It's much cheaper to validate ideas
                    with users before building than to rebuild after launch.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Real-World Example: The OXO Good Grips Story</h4>
            <p>
                In 1990, Sam Farber watched his wife struggle to use a traditional vegetable peeler due to arthritis.
                Instead of just making it easier for people with arthritis, he used empathy to realize that EVERYONE
                would benefit from more comfortable kitchen tools. OXO Good Grips was born, revolutionizing kitchen
                products by designing for the extremes and benefiting all users. This is empathy-driven design at its best.

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>User Research Methods</h2>
        <p>
            To build empathy, we need to conduct user research. Here are the main methods designers use to understand their users:
        </p>

        <h3>1. User Interviews 🗣️</h3>
        <p>
            One-on-one conversations with users to understand their experiences, needs, and pain points.
            The key is to ask open-ended questions and listen actively.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Good questions:</strong> "Tell me about the last time you tried to..." or "How do you currently handle...?"</li>
            <li><strong>Bad questions:</strong> "Would you use a feature that does X?" (leading question that doesn't reveal real behavior)</li>
            <li><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Ask "why" at least five times to dig deeper into motivations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Observations & Shadowing 👀</h3>
        <p>
            Watching users in their natural environment as they complete tasks. People often do things differently
            than they describe in interviews.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Observe without interrupting - let users work naturally</li>
            <li>Take notes on workarounds, frustrations, and unexpected behaviors</li>
            <li>Look for what users do, not just what they say</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Surveys & Questionnaires 📊</h3>
        <p>
            Gathering data from a larger group of users. Useful for validating patterns seen in interviews
            and understanding scale.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a mix of quantitative (ratings, scales) and qualitative (open-ended) questions</li>
            <li>Keep surveys short - long surveys have low completion rates</li>
            <li>Be careful with self-reported data - what people say and do often differ</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Contextual Inquiry 🏠</h3>
        <p>
            A combination of interviews and observation where you watch users in their environment
            while asking questions about what they're doing and why.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Creating User Personas</h2>
        <p>
            A persona is a fictional character that represents a key user type. Personas help teams keep
            real users in mind throughout the design process.
        </p>

        <div class="concept-card" style="margin: 20px 0;">
            <h4>📋 What Goes in a Persona?</h4>
            <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                <li><strong>Name & Photo:</strong> Make them feel like a real person</li>
                <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Age, occupation, location (when relevant)</li>
                <li><strong>Goals:</strong> What they're trying to achieve</li>
                <li><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Current pain points and challenges</li>
                <li><strong>Behaviors:</strong> How they currently solve problems</li>
                <li><strong>Motivations:</strong> What drives their decisions</li>
                <li><strong>Quote:</strong> Something they might say that captures their mindset</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example Persona: Sarah, the Busy College Student</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Age:</strong> 20 | <strong>Major:</strong> Biology | <strong>Tech Level:</strong> High<br><br>
                <strong>Goals:</strong> Balance coursework, part-time job, and social life. Stay organized without spending hours planning.<br><br>
                <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Existing calendar apps are too complex. Constantly forgets assignments. Overwhelmed by notifications.<br><br>
                <strong>Behaviors:</strong> Uses phone for everything. Checks social media between classes. Prefers quick, visual information.<br><br>
                <strong>Quote:</strong> "I need something that just works. I don't have time to set up complicated systems."

        <h2>Empathy Mapping</h2>
        <p>
            An empathy map is a visual tool that helps you understand what a user says, thinks, feels, and does.
            It's a quick way to synthesize research findings and build team alignment.

            <strong>How to use it:</strong> After conducting research, gather your team and fill out an empathy map together.
            Look for patterns and contradictions between what users say and do.

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Needs vs. Wants</h2>
        <p>
            A crucial skill in HCD is distinguishing between what users <em>say they want</em> and what they <em>actually need</em>.
        </p>

        <div class="concept-grid">
            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>🎤 Wants (Stated)</h4>
                <p>
                    What users explicitly ask for. Often framed as feature requests or solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Example: "I want a faster horse" - Henry Ford's customers</em>

            </div>

            <div class="concept-card">
                <h4>💎 Needs (Underlying)</h4>
                <p>
                    The real problem or goal beneath the surface. Discovered through research and observation.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>Reality: They needed faster transportation → The car was born</em>

                <br>- Often attributed to Henry Ford (though possibly apocryphal)
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Your job as a designer is to dig beneath surface-level wants to uncover true needs. Listen to the problem,
            not the proposed solution.

    <div class="case-study">
        <h3>🏥 Case Study: Redesigning the MRI Experience</h3>
        <p>
            GE Healthcare wanted to make MRI machines more efficient. Through empathy research, designer Doug Dietz
            discovered that children were terrified of the machines - some needed sedation just to get scanned.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
            <strong>The Insight:</strong> Kids weren't scared of medical procedures - they were scared of the big,
            loud, intimidating machine and sterile hospital environment.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
            <strong>The Solution:</strong> Transform MRI rooms into adventure themes. The "pirate ship" scanner, the
            "jungle adventure," etc. Kids were coached to "stay very still so you don't wake the baby elephant."
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
            <strong>The Result:</strong> Sedation rates dropped dramatically. Children asked to go back. Same machine,
            completely different experience - all because of empathy.
