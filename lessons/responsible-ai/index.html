    <h1>🎓 Responsible AI Usage - How Students Should Interact With AI Tools</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
        <p>
            AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and others are powerful learning assistants - but they're not
            magical homework machines. How you use AI can be the difference between accelerating your learning
            and undermining your education.
        </p>
        <p>
            This lesson will help you understand when AI use enhances your learning, when it crosses ethical lines,
            and how to use these tools responsibly to become a better thinker and problem-solver.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>The Core Question: Are You Learning or Just Getting Answers?</h2>
        <p>
            The fundamental principle of responsible AI use in education is simple: <strong>AI should help you learn,
            not replace your learning.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Ask yourself: "After using AI, do I understand the material better, or did I just get something to submit?"
            If it's the latter, you're cheating yourself even if you're not technically cheating.
        </p>

        <h2>Appropriate vs. Inappropriate AI Use</h2>

        <div class="comparison-grid">

                <h4>✅ Responsible Use - These Enhance Learning</h4>
                <ul class="scenario-list">
                    <li><strong>Explaining concepts:</strong> "Can you explain photosynthesis in simpler terms?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Getting unstuck:</strong> "I'm stuck on this math problem. Can you explain the concept, not solve it?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> "What are some angles I could explore for my essay on climate change?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Checking understanding:</strong> "Can you quiz me on the French Revolution?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Finding resources:</strong> "What are good sources to research renewable energy?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Learning new skills:</strong> "How do I start learning Python? What's a roadmap?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Debugging code:</strong> "Why isn't my loop working? Help me understand the error."</li>
                    <li><strong>Improving your work:</strong> "Can you give feedback on my draft? What could be clearer?"</li>

                    <li><strong>Violating academic policies:</strong> Using AI when your teacher/professor explicitly prohibits it</li>

        <h2>The Risks of Over-Reliance on AI</h2>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>⚠️ You're Not Building Skills - You're Renting Them</h4>
            <p>
                When you use AI to do your thinking, you're not developing critical skills that you'll need in life.
                Imagine an athlete who uses a robot to do their workouts - they might win trophies, but they'd never
                actually get stronger. That's what happens when you over-rely on AI for schoolwork.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="principle-grid">
            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🧠 Critical Thinking Atrophy</h4>
                <p>
                    Every time AI solves a problem for you, you miss an opportunity to strengthen your problem-solving
                    muscles. Critical thinking is like any skill - use it or lose it.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>📉 Knowledge Gaps</h4>
                <p>
                    Education builds on itself. If AI helps you skip foundational concepts, you'll struggle later when
                    you need that knowledge. You can't build the second floor without the first.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>❌ Exam Failures</h4>
                <p>
                    Tests and exams don't allow AI. If you've been using AI as a crutch all semester, you'll be lost
                    when you have to perform on your own. Many students face this harsh reality too late.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🎓 Career Unpreparedness</h4>
                <p>
                    Employers hire you for skills and knowledge. If you used AI to fake those skills in school, you'll
                    struggle in job interviews and on the job. Your career will suffer from shortcuts you took years ago.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🔍 Loss of Originality</h4>
                <p>
                    AI generates generic, average responses. Over-reliance on AI means you never develop your unique
                    voice, creative thinking, or original perspectives - qualities that make you irreplaceable.

            </div>

                <h4>⚖️ Ethical Compromise</h4>
                <p>
                    Once you start using AI to cheat "just this once," it gets easier each time. This erodes your
                    integrity and sets a pattern that can follow you into your professional life.

                <li><strong>After you've tried:</strong> Use AI when you're stuck after genuine effort, not as your first step</li>
                <li><strong>To check your work:</strong> Verify your answers or get feedback after you've completed the work yourself</li>
                <li><strong>For scaffolding:</strong> Get a framework or outline, then fill it in with your own thinking</li>
