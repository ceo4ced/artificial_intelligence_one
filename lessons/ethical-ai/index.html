    <h1>🧭 Ethical AI - What Makes an AI Decision Fair?</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <h2>What is Ethical AI?</h2>
        <p>
            Ethical AI is about designing and deploying artificial intelligence systems that respect human values,
            rights, and dignity. It asks the critical question: just because we <em>can</em> build an AI to do
            something, <em>should</em> we?
        </p>
        <p>
            As AI becomes more powerful and widespread, ethical considerations become increasingly important.
            AI systems can impact lives, jobs, privacy, and fundamental rights - making ethics not just a nice-to-have,
            but a necessity.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Core Principles of Ethical AI</h2>

        <div class="principle-grid">
            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>⚖️ Fairness & Non-Discrimination</h4>
                <p>
                    AI systems should treat all people equitably and not discriminate based on race, gender,
                    age, disability, or other protected characteristics. Outcomes should be just and unbiased.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🔍 Transparency & Explainability</h4>
                <p>
                    People should understand how AI makes decisions that affect them. "Black box" systems that
                    can't explain their reasoning undermine trust and accountability.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🎯 Accountability</h4>
                <p>
                    There must be clear responsibility when AI systems cause harm. Organizations and developers
                    should be accountable for the AI they create and deploy.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🔒 Privacy & Data Protection</h4>
                <p>
                    AI should respect people's privacy and protect their data. Personal information should be
                    collected, used, and stored responsibly with appropriate consent.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🛡️ Safety & Security</h4>
                <p>
                    AI systems must be reliable, robust, and safe. They should be tested thoroughly and protected
                    against misuse, hacking, and unintended harmful consequences.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🤝 Human Autonomy & Control</h4>
                <p>
                    AI should augment and empower humans, not replace human judgment in critical decisions.
                    People should remain in control and be able to override AI when necessary.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>🌍 Social Benefit</h4>
                <p>
                    AI should be developed to benefit society and advance the common good, not just maximize
                    profit. It should help solve important problems and reduce inequality.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="principle-card">
                <h4>♻️ Sustainability</h4>
                <p>
                    AI development should consider environmental impact. Training large models consumes significant
                    energy - ethical AI considers this cost and seeks sustainable approaches.
                </p>
            </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <h2>Ethical Dilemmas in AI</h2>

        <div class="dilemma-box">
            <h4>🚗 The Self-Driving Car Dilemma</h4>
            <p>
                A self-driving car's brakes fail. It must choose between hitting five pedestrians crossing
                illegally or swerving into a wall, likely killing the passenger. Who should the car prioritize?
                Should it protect its passenger at all costs? Minimize total casualties? Follow traffic laws?
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <strong>Ethical Questions:</strong> How do we program moral choices? Who decides whose life is
                worth more? Should the car's behavior depend on whether the passenger owns the car?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="dilemma-box">
            <h4>⚖️ The Predictive Policing Dilemma</h4>
            <p>
                AI can predict where crimes are likely to occur based on historical data. But this data reflects
                biased policing patterns - communities that were over-policed in the past show more arrests.
                Using this data creates a feedback loop: send more police there, get more arrests, AI predicts
                more crime there, repeat.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <strong>Ethical Questions:</strong> Is it fair to use historical data that reflects past injustice?
                Can predictive policing ever be ethical? Should we ban it entirely or try to make it fairer?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="dilemma-box">
            <h4>🏥 The Medical AI Dilemma</h4>
            <p>
                An AI system can predict which patients are at high risk for expensive medical conditions.
                Insurance companies want to use this to price premiums. While this may be "actuarially fair,"
                it could make insurance unaffordable for sick people who need it most.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <strong>Ethical Questions:</strong> Should AI-driven pricing be allowed in healthcare? Does
                efficiency justify potentially denying care to vulnerable people? What's more important -
                mathematical fairness or social fairness?
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="dilemma-box">
            <h4>👁️ The Surveillance Dilemma</h4>
            <p>
                AI-powered facial recognition could help find missing children and wanted criminals much faster.
                But it also enables mass surveillance, tracking everyone's movements without consent. China
                uses it to monitor and control citizens; democracies debate whether any use is acceptable.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                <strong>Ethical Questions:</strong> Do the benefits outweigh privacy costs? Where do we draw
                the line? Can surveillance technology be used ethically, or is it inherently problematic?
            </p>

        <h3>Making Ethical AI Decisions: A Framework</h3>
        <p style="color: #01579b; margin-bottom: 15px;">When evaluating an AI system's ethics, consider these questions:</p>

        <ol style="line-height: 2; color: #01579b; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What problem does this AI solve? Is it a problem worth solving?</li>
            <li><strong>Stakeholders:</strong> Who is affected? Did we include their perspectives?</li>
            <li><strong>Harms:</strong> What could go wrong? Who could be hurt?</li>
            <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Who benefits? Are benefits distributed fairly?</li>
            <li><strong>Alternatives:</strong> Could we achieve the goal without AI? With less invasive AI?</li>
            <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Do people know this AI is being used on them? Can they opt out?</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Can people understand how it works and why it made a decision?</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> If something goes wrong, who is responsible?</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Have we tested for bias and errors across all groups?</li>
            <li><strong>Oversight:</strong> Is there human review for high-stakes decisions?</li>
        </ol>
